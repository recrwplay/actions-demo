# Vale

## Prerequisites

1. Install Vale according to the instructions on the link:https://vale.sh/docs/vale-cli/installation/[website].
2. Make sure Vale is installed correctly by running `vale` in the command line.
3. (Optional) Install the Vale plugin in VSCode.

## Run Vale

The basic way to run Vale is the following:

```
vale --config /path/to/vale/.vale.ini /path/to/doc/repo/modules/ROOT/pages/index.adoc
```

Here `/path/to/vale/` is the path to this repository, where the `.vale.ini` file can be found.
The `/path/to/doc/repo/` instead is the path to the repository containing the docs you want to run Vale on.

For example, run Vale with the included `.ini` file and the test Asciidoc file:

```
vale --config vale/.vale.ini vale/test.adoc
```

## Add a style

To add a new style (for example the Google style guide) in the Vale configuration, do the following:

1. Edit the `vale.ini` file to either add `Google` to the `BasedOnStyles` (to add all the style rules by default, and optionally disable some), or add single rules such as `Google.DateFormat = YES`.
2. Run `vale --config vale/.vale.ini sync` to download the new style (if it has not been downloaded before).

NOTE: Any external styles added to the `vale/styles` directory (except our custom ones) must be added to `.gitignore`.

## Add terms to the vocabulary

You can add terms with their accepted spelling in the `accept.txt` file(s) within the `vale/config/vocabularies` subdirectories.

NOTE: Do not add entries where an entry fully contains another one, such as `Neo4j` and `Neo4j Aura`.
Use the `Neo4j/Names.yml` rule for single words instead.

## Run tests

After any update, run the `test-script.sh` script and inspect any differences in the test results file.
