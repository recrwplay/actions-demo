# Use this starter workflow in your repo to publish a development or production AWS S3 bucket
# By default it runs against the default branch and assumes the default branch publishes to production S3
# You can change this by adding branches, and specifying a different branch in the publish 'if' statements
# sync-args are passed to the aws s3 action
# --dryrun is included to prevent accidental publishing - remove this when you are ready to publish
